## Supported Minidump Types

This plugin currently only supports loading minidump files generated by the Windows [`MiniDumpWriteDump` API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minidumpapiset/nf-minidumpapiset-minidumpwritedump).

This includes dumps generated from:

- The [`.dump` command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-dump--create-dump-file-) in WinDbg.
- The `.dump` command in Binary Ninja's debugger for Windows targets (which uses the same debugging engine as WinDbg).

For both of the above, it's recommended to generate a full dump:

```
.dump /ma dumpfile.dmp
```

- The [`minidump` command](https://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/commands/memory-operations/minidump.html) in x64dbg.

```
minidump dumpfile.dmp
```

- Right clicking on a listed process and then clicking "Create dump file" / "Create full dump" from Windows Task Manager, Process Hacker, Sysinternals Process Explorer, etc...

## Unsupported Features (for now)

- Loading Minidump files from platforms or APIs other than Windows' `MinidumpWriteDump`, such as those generated by [Google Breakpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad/).
- Loading and applyng debug information from the minidump file. In Windows minidump files, `MinidumpModuleList` streams contain information about the PDB file which contains the debug information for the module; this isn't currently read or applied, however.
- Integration with Binary Ninja's built-in debugger. Minidump files can contain information about threads, register values, and stack frames, and it would be nice in the future for minidump files to be loadable back into the debugger in order to resume a debugging session. This isn't currently done, however.

## Building and Installing

This plugin currently needs to be built from source, then copied into your user plugin folder.

```
cargo build --release
cp target/release/libminidump_bn.so ~/.binaryninja/plugins/
```

The code in this plugin targets the `dev` branch of the [Binary Ninja Rust API](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/tree/dev/rust).
