## Supported Minidump Types

This plugin currently only supports loading minidump files generated by the Windows [`MiniDumpWriteDump` API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minidumpapiset/nf-minidumpapiset-minidumpwritedump).

This includes dumps generated from:

- The [`.dump` command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-dump--create-dump-file-) in WinDbg.
- The `.dump` command in Binary Ninja's debugger for Windows targets (which uses the same debugging engine as WinDbg).

For both of the above, it's recommended to generate a full dump:

```
.dump /ma dumpfile.dmp
```

- The [`minidump` command](https://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/commands/memory-operations/minidump.html) in x64dbg.

```
minidump dumpfile.dmp
```

- Right clicking on a listed process and then clicking "Create dump file" / "Create full dump" from Windows Task Manager, Process Hacker, Sysinternals Process Explorer, etc...

Minidump files from other platforms, such as those generated by [Google Breakpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad/), are currently not supported.

## Building and Installing

This plugin currently needs to be built from source, then copied into your user plugin folder.

```
cargo build --release
cp target/release/libminidump_bn.so ~/.binaryninja/plugins/
```

The code in this plugin targets the `dev` branch of the [Binary Ninja Rust API](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/tree/dev/rust).
